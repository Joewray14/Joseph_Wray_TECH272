            <p>In October <time datetime="2018">2018</time>, she sued the rapper Nicki Minaj over copyright infringement, alleging that Minaj had sampled her song "Baby Can I Hold You" without permission. Chapman stated that she had "repeatedly denied" permission for "Baby Can I Hold You" to be sampled. The lawsuit alleged that Minaj had engaged in copyright infringement (a) by creating the song "Sorry" and (b) by distributing it; she requested an injunction to prevent Minaj from releasing the song. According to the lawsuit, Chapman has a policy of declining all requests for permission to sample her songs. In <time datetime="2020-09">September 2020</time>, District Court Judge Virginia A. Phillips granted summary judgment in favor of Minaj on the first count of her complaint, stating that Minaj&rsquo;s experimentation with Chapman&rsquo;s song constituted fair use rather than copyright infringement. However, the judge ruled that the second count of the complaint should go to trial. In <time datetime="2021-01">January 2021</time>, the dispute was settled when Minaj paid Chapman $450,000.</p>
